Document Storage

Document Storage is a sample application and not intended for actual use. The project uses the Catalyst MVC framework
to archive text based documents.

Documents are stored in two database tables one containing the entire document and the other containing the split up
sentences from the document. Searching the documents is provided via MySQL's full text search functionality.

MySQLs full text search was selected as the remit was to upload the sentences individually to a database, however
I'd be far more likely to use a third party full text searching system such as Lucene or Sphinx due to their
enhanced indexing and search functionalities. 

As the sample files do not contain Byte Order Marks the encoding has been detected using the header included in the
file.

In order to get the project running locally create a database and enter the credentials to connect to the db in 
docstore.conf in the root of the project and run the migration in the migrations folder. Run "perl Makefile.PL" 
and "make". You should then be able to run "perl script/docstore_server.pl" from the command line. Connect to the 
server via http://localhost:3000/

The Tests are far from functionally complete but are there simply to prove the concept. To run them use 
"prove -Ilib t".
